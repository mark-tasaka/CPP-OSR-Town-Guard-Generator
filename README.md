# CPP-OSR-Town-Guard-Generator
D20 role-playing game system.  Each town guard will have unique individual stastics based on the siz core ability scores of the D20 system: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.  The ability scores, along with the hit points, of the guards are generated by stimulation the die roll mechanics (i.e., 3d6 dice roll) of the D20 system.  Options will be added to allow for better optimization of the town guard statistics.
